# Personal Website

This repository contains my own personal website that I built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

Feel free to use any code for your own thing!

If you're interested in how I got to move my face, you should check out this [AI model](https://replicate.com/kylan02/face-looker) ;)

If you want to run the website locally, follow these steps:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```
